# A Markov Chain based new word generator for Estonian

* Ingest public domain Estonian literature to a Markov Chain based model.
* The model predicts the next most likely letter and generates new words.
* The aim was to generate brand new estonian words.
* As expected the results were mostly nonsensical but amusing :D
